# Train
Created a train as a custom doubly linked list where users can add/remove train cars, update products on a specific train, and display information in various formats.

<h2>Description</h2>
Remember when we used to play with trains/cars (toys)? We used to put stuff on cars and make them travel through the house. It's fun, right? Would you like to play with it again? Well, this project can help you with that. Instead of playing with a physical toy car, this project would allow you to build a text-based train car. Initially, you would have an empty train. There will be a menu listing all the available commands. You can add a custom train car by calling the insert command, where you have to provide information such as the weight and length. After the insertion, you may put products on the train. It can be apples, gold, or even Hydrogen bombs. Of course, if you no longer need a specific train car, you can delete it by moving to that car and calling the remove command. In conclusion, when running this program, you're the God Of Creation, controlling how the train appears.

<h2>Get Started</h2>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">Java JDK 15 or Higher</a></li>
  <li>Text Editor or IDEs</li>
  <h4>Recommend:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Notepad (Worst Case).</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?fromIDE=&section=windows">IntelliJ IDEA</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://replit.com/~">Repl.it</a></li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Installing</h3>
Visit the src directory to see all the required Java files. To run the program, individuals must download those files and put them in the same directory.

<h3>Executing program</h3>
Run directly in IDEs
<br>
Or
<br>
Do the following in the terminal (the following example is run in the Windows PowerShell):
<br><br>
<ol>
  <li>Check if Java is installed on your computer</li>
  <code>C:\Users\anon> java -version</code>
  <br>
  If installed, it should display the Java version. 
  If an error is presented, download Java from <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">Orcale</a>.
  <br><br>
  <li>Check if you can access the Java compiler</li>
  <code>C:\Users\anon> javac</code>
  <br>
  It should display some information about the compiler.
  If not, Follow the steps on <a href="http://www.skylit.com/javamethods/faqs/javaindos.html">this site</a>.
  <br><br>
  <li>Change the directory to the one that contains your Java files. Let's call this directory "JavaProgram"</li>
  <code>C:\Users\anon> cd JavaProgram</code> => <code>C:\Users\anon\JavaProgram></code>
  <br><br>
  <li>Compile the file you want to execute. Let's call this file "RunMe.java"</li>
  <code>C:\Users\anon\JavaProgram> javac RunMe.java</code>
  <br>
  This will create the class file "RunMe.class."
  <br><br>
  <li>Run the program</li>
  <code>C:\Users\anon\JavaProgram> java RunMe.java</code>
</ol>
